# AI-Powered-Incident-Management-Analytics-Dashboard-
AI-Powered Incident Management &amp; Analytics Dashboard — A data analytics project integrating Python, Power BI, and Generative AI to analyze ServiceNow incidents, track SLA performance, and generate AI-based summaries for smarter IT operations.


This project demonstrates how Data Analytics and Generative AI can transform IT incident management.
Using ServiceNow data, it builds an intelligent Power BI dashboard that tracks SLA breaches, analyzes resolution trends, and generates AI-based summaries of incidents.

The solution integrates Python (for preprocessing & summarization) and Power BI (for visualization) to create a seamless analytics experience that helps IT teams:
	•	Monitor incident volumes and SLA compliance
	•	Understand recurring issues faster
	•	Improve service delivery with AI insights

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, Power BI, Hugging Face Transformers, Pandas, TQDM
🔹 Data Source: ServiceNow (Critical Incident Management module)
🔹 AI Integration: BART-large-CNN model for summarizing incident notes
